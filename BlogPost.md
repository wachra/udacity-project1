## Introduction
As a student of a technical course of studies [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is my starting point to get questions about a programming language answered. Since Stackoverflow does not provide private communication between users, little is known about them. This article tries to shed some light on this by using the Stackoverflow [2014](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B0DL28AqnGsrempjMktvWFNaQzA) and [2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV) survey data to answer three questions.

## Which programming languages have become more popular within the last 5 years?
As a student, one constantly asks oneself whether the acquired knowledge is also that which will be needed in the later job. Of course this also applies to programming languages. Therefore it would be interesting to know which programming languages have gained or lost popularity within the last five years. The following graphic will answer this question.

It is obvious that the languages Python and Javascript have gained significantly in popularity among Stackoverflow users over the last five years with an increase of 18.7% and 8.9% respectively. Among the losers are the programming languages C# and objective C, which have a minus of 6% and 5.7%. So if you are looking for a seminal programming language for the next few years, Python or Javascript may your best bet.

 

In 2014 wurden die Programmiersprachen noch vorgegeben

## Do experienced developers tend to work from home and how has this changed over the last 5 years?

## Is Stackoverflow less used in European countries where the percentage of English language skills is considered lower?

Annahme: Die Zahl der Studienteilnehmer pro Land ist proportional zu den Besuchern von Stackoverflow, die nicht an der Studie teilgenommen haben.
Ein Erhöhen des Englischniveaus würde evtl mit besseren Programmierfähigkeiten einhergehen bzw. zu schnelleren Antwortzeiten

## Conclusion
In this article, we took a look at XXXXXXXX according to Stack Overflow 2017 survey data.
