# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Project 1
This Repository contains the files for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. Since I am a technical student who often looks for advice on Stackoverflow I would like to learn a little more about the users.

### 1. Installations
- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

### 2. File Descriptions
- **BlogPost.md**: A blog post about my finding of Stackoverflow's surveys
- **StackOverFlow_Comparison.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that keeps my calculations and results

### 3. Findings
- *Python* and *Javascript* are the most rapidly growing programming languages.
- Older developers work from home more often than younger ones.
- The better the English level in a country, the higher the probability they will visit Stackoverflow

### 4. Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) who made the survey results freely [availabe](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and the survey participants.
